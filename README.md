# Post-transcriptional regulation across human tissues


This repository contains code for analyzing post-transcriptional regulation across human tissues based on mRNA and protein datasets. The analysis was reported by [Franks et al., PLOS Computational Biology (2017)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005535). The [website](http://slavovlab.net/2016_PTR/index.html) of the paper contains additional resources.

## Reproducing the analysis reported by [Franks et al., 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005535)

- Most of the results and figures can be generated by running the code **tissue-ptr.R**
- The code for the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is in **analysis.R**
- Relative PTR comparisons between different protein datasets (Kim et al. and Wilhelm et al.) are evaluated in **rptr.r**
- Most relevant and necessary data (excluded the "raw" preprocessed data) is in the data/ dir.
- Raw data are available here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4nzzqtsoixsh5gm/AAAMtqZ9qU8F1ggyaIM9prqKa?dl=0
- Raw data are normalized using code in **preprocess_\*.R** files
